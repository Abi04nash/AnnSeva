# AnnSeva

**AnnSeva** is a full-stack food donation and management web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It helps reduce food wastage by connecting individual donors with NGOs and food banks, where individual donors can register and post food donations collected from restaurants, hotels, or events. NGOs and food banks can view and request these donations for redistribution to underprivileged people.
The platform ensures transparency, real-time updates, and a seamless donation process for all users.

## 🧭 How AnnSeva Works

AnnSeva follows a simple and real-world food donation workflow:

1. **Donor Registration**
   Restaurants, hotels, event organizers, or individuals register as donors.

2. **Post Food Donation**
   Donors post surplus food with details like quantity, pickup location, source type, and expiry (time or quantity-based).

3. **Active Donation Listing**
   The donation becomes visible to nearby NGOs and food banks in real-time.

4. **NGO / Food Bank Applies**
   NGOs or food banks browse available donations and apply for pickup.

5. **Donor Approval**
   Donors review requests and accept or reject them.

6. **Food Collection & Completion**
   Approved NGOs collect the food, and the donation status is updated automatically.

7. **Automatic Expiry Handling**
   Donations automatically expire when time or quantity limits are reached.
