🍱 AnnSeva

AnnSeva is a full-stack food donation and management web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
It helps reduce food wastage by connecting individual donors, restaurants, and event organizers with NGOs and food banks, who then distribute the food to underprivileged people.
The platform ensures transparency, real-time updates, and a seamless donation process for all users.
